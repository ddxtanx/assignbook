<h1>Easy AssignBook</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Assignment Tracker!</h3>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<h4> Sometimes, school can be a pain. A assignment sheet could be forgotten, a homework announced could be missed, you might have been napping, but somebody was paying attention! This site is designed so students can share what
happened in class, to everyone in the class. Forgot what your teacher was putting on the test? No problem! Just ask your classmates on the class page! Forgot what your homework was for tonight? Just look at your homework
page! Didn't take notes in class? Somebody already shared them! Your school experience will be so much easier when you use Easy AssignBook!
</h4>
